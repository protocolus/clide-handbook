Alerts that matter:

```javascript
clide alerts configure --intelligent

// CLIDE learns from:
- Historical incidents
- False positive feedback
- Team response patterns
- Business impact

// Generates smart alerts:
{
  "payment-service-degradation": {
    condition: "error_rate > baseline_p99 * 2",
    correlation: ["recent_deploy", "traffic_spike", "dependency_issue"],
    severity: "dynamic_based_on_revenue_impact",
    notify: "on-call IF severity > medium",
    auto_remediate: ["scale_up", "circuit_break", "rollback"]
  }
}
```

### Predictive Monitoring

Prevent issues before they occur:

```bash
clide monitor predict

# Predictions for next 24h:

⚠️ Memory Pressure Warning
  Service: user-api
  Current: 72% (trending ↑)
  Predicted: 95% by 3 PM tomorrow
  Cause: Memory leak in cache layer
  Action: Schedule restart at 2 AM

⚠️ Traffic Spike Expected
  Time: Tomorrow 10 AM
  Volume: 3x normal (marketing campaign)
  Risk: API rate limits
  Action: Pre-scale to 5 instances

✓ Database Performance
  No issues predicted
  Auto-optimization scheduled
```

### Automated Incident Response

Self-healing production issues:

```javascript
// Incident detected
clide incident auto-respond

// CLIDE's response:
{
  detection: "3:42 AM - API response time > 5s",
  
  analysis: {
    root_cause: "Database connection pool exhausted",
    impact: "30% of requests failing",
    affected_users: "~2,400",
    revenue_impact: "$8,000/hour"
  },
  
  actions_taken: [
    {time: "3:43 AM", action: "Increased connection pool 50 → 100"},
    {time: "3:43 AM", action: "Restarted stuck connections"},
    {time: "3:44 AM", action: "Scaled API servers 3 → 5"},
    {time: "3:45 AM", action: "Notified on-call (low urgency)"}
  ],
  
  resolution: {
    time: "3:46 AM",
    status: "Fully resolved",
    metrics: "All metrics returned to normal"
  },
